# 🔐 SentinelMesh

**Modular Incident Response for Web3 Protocols**  
Respond to chaos like it’s routine.

## 🧠 What is SentinelMesh?

SentinelMesh is a modular, real-time incident response framework designed for high-severity events in Web3 protocols. It ingests on-chain alerts, applies triage logic, executes runbooks, and orchestrates multisig-based emergency actions—all while maintaining auditability and calm coordination.

Inspired by the fast-moving demands of protocol defense teams, SentinelMesh is built to stop $100M exploits before the tweet thread goes viral.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Multisig Watchdog**: Monitor Gnosis Safe transactions for unauthorized or anomalous behavior.
- **Alert Triage Engine**: Ingest alerts from Forta, Cyvers, and Hypernative, triage based on rules or ML patterns.
- **Runbook-as-Code**: Use YAML-defined workflows for consistent escalation and response.
- **On-Chain Response Toolkit**: Automate contract pauses, access revocation, and upgrade triggers.
- **Audit Logging**: Every action is traceable by incident ID, timestamp, and tx hash.
- **Signal Relay**: Send real-time encrypted alert messages to responders.

## 🔁 Example Incident Flow

1. Forta bot emits alert for multisig signer anomaly.
2. Triage Engine detects **High Severity** → triggers `pause_protocol.sh`.
3. Runbook executes Gnosis Safe SDK script to submit pause transaction.
4. Signal Bot notifies incident room with tx hash and summary.
5. Audit log writes full response trail with responder tag.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

Alert Sources → 🧠 Triage Engine → 📜 Runbook Executor → 🔐 Multisig Ops + 📲 Signal Relay → 📓 Audit Logger


Modular, decoupled, and designed to plug into any SOC workflow or incident simulation environment.

## 🚧 Status

Currently in **planning and scaffolding phase**, with focus areas including:
- Defining initial triage logic and YAML-based rule engine
- Mocking detection flows and sample runbooks for critical scenarios
- Designing architecture layout and incident simulation logic
- Preparing initial repository structure for GitHub launch

## 💡 Why It Exists

Protocols don’t get a second chance when things go sideways. SentinelMesh is designed to provide the calm, structured muscle memory needed when incidents strike. With clear escalation logic and modular response tooling, it's built to help Web3 defenders operate faster, smarter, and under pressure—without panic.
